# AI Email Parser Debug Guide

## Issue: "Failed to parse email"

This guide will help you debug and fix the AI Email Parser issue step by step.

## Step 1: Verify API Key Configuration

### ‚úÖ API Key Status
- **Development**: ‚úÖ Configured (`sk-proj-ae8Ct4t...`)
- **Staging**: ‚úÖ Configured (`sk-proj-ae8Ct4t...`)
- **Production**: ‚úÖ Configured (`sk-proj-ae8Ct4t...`)

### ‚úÖ Configuration Files
- `Secrets-Development.xcconfig` ‚úÖ
- `Secrets-Staging.xcconfig` ‚úÖ
- `Secrets-Production.xcconfig` ‚úÖ

## Step 2: Test API Key Loading

### In Xcode Console:
1. Build and run the app
2. Go to "Deals" tab
3. Tap the üí∞ button
4. Choose "üìß Parse Email with AI"
5. Check the console for these logs:

**Expected Logs:**
```
SecureAPIManager: Loaded API key from Secrets-Development.xcconfig
AI Parser: API Key found: sk-proj-ae8Ct4t...
AI Parser: Starting AI email parsing...
AI Parser: Making API request to: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
AI Parser: API Response Status: 200
AI Parser: API Response received, parsing JSON...
AI Parser: Successfully parsed deal data
```

**If you see errors:**
- `AI Configuration Error: AI services not configured` ‚Üí API key not loading
- `API Key Error: API key not available` ‚Üí SecureAPIManager issue
- `API Error 401: Unauthorized` ‚Üí Invalid API key
- `API Error 429: Rate limited` ‚Üí Rate limit exceeded
- `JSON parsing failed` ‚Üí AI response format issue

## Step 3: Test with Sample Image

### Create Test Image:
1. Take a screenshot of any email
2. Save it to Photos
3. Use it in the AI parser

### Expected Behavior:
1. Image picker opens
2. You select an image
3. Loading indicator appears
4. Form gets populated with parsed data
5. You can edit and save the deal

## Step 4: Debug Common Issues

### Issue 1: "AI services not configured"
**Cause**: API key not loading from xcconfig files
**Fix**: 
- Check that xcconfig files are in the app bundle
- Verify file names match SecureAPIManager expectations
- Check console for "SecureAPIManager: Loaded API key" message

### Issue 2: "API key not available"
**Cause**: SecureAPIManager not finding the key
**Fix**:
- Check that the app is running in DEBUG mode
- Verify the xcconfig files are properly formatted
- Check for typos in the API key

### Issue 3: "API Error 401: Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Invalid or expired API key
**Fix**:
- Verify the API key is correct
- Check if the key has expired
- Ensure the key has proper permissions

### Issue 4: "API Error 429: Rate limited"
**Cause**: Too many API requests
**Fix**:
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Check your OpenAI usage dashboard
- Consider upgrading your plan

### Issue 5: "JSON parsing failed"
**Cause**: AI response format issue
**Fix**:
- Check the raw API response in console
- Verify the AI is returning valid JSON
- Check if the prompt needs adjustment

## Step 5: Test the Complete Flow

### Test Steps:
1. **Build and Run**: Ensure app builds without errors
2. **Navigate to Deals**: Go to the "Deals" tab
3. **Add Deal**: Tap the üí∞ button
4. **Choose AI Option**: Select "üìß Parse Email with AI"
5. **Select Image**: Choose an email screenshot
6. **Wait for Processing**: Watch for loading indicator
7. **Check Results**: Verify form is populated
8. **Save Deal**: Complete the deal creation

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Form fields populated with parsed data
- ‚úÖ No error messages
- ‚úÖ Deal saved successfully
- ‚úÖ Deal appears in the deals list

## Step 6: Advanced Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging:
The AI Email Parser now includes comprehensive logging. Check the console for:

```
AI Parser: Starting AI email parsing...
AI Parser: API Key found: sk-proj-ae8Ct4t...
AI Parser: Making API request to: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
AI Parser: API Response Status: 200
AI Parser: Raw API response: {"title": "Brand Partnership", ...}
AI Parser: Cleaned response: {"title": "Brand Partnership", ...}
AI Parser: Successfully parsed deal data
```

### Check Network Requests:
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to Debug ‚Üí View Debugging ‚Üí View Memory Graph
3. Look for network requests in the console
4. Check if the request is being made

### Verify Image Processing:
1. Check if the image is being converted to base64
2. Verify the image size is reasonable
3. Ensure the image format is supported

## Step 7: Troubleshooting Checklist
