# On Brand - AI-Powered Style & Photo Analysis iOS App

An AI-powered style and photo analysis iOS app with Instagram-style UI components, built with SwiftUI, MVVM architecture, and comprehensive Firebase backend integration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierson-davis/on-brand-ios.git
cd on-brand-ios
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./Scripts/setup-development-environment.sh
```

### 3. Configure API Keys
The app requires OpenAI API keys for AI features. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use Your Own API Key (Recommended)
1. Get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Edit `on brand/App/Secrets-Development.xcconfig`
3. Replace `<your-development-openai-api-key-here>` with your actual key

#### Option B: Quick Development Setup
For immediate development, you can use the working API key from the git history:
```bash
# Extract the working API key from git history
git show 2aa8213:on\ brand/App/Secrets-Development.xcconfig | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
# Copy the key and paste it into your Secrets-Development.xcconfig file
```

### 4. Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Download your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
3. Replace the placeholder files in `on brand/App/` with your actual Firebase configuration

### 5. Build and Run
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open "on brand.xcodeproj"

# Or build from command line
xcodebuild -project "on brand.xcodeproj" -scheme "on brand" -configuration Debug
```
